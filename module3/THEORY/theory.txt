5)-How will you create a dictionary using tuples in python?

6)-How Do You Traverse Through A Dictionary Object In Python? 
ANS--Using dict. items() Method. ...
     Using Keys() Method. To iterate through the dictionary's keys, utilise the 
     keys()method that is supplied by the dictionary. ...
     Using Values() Method. ...
     Iterating with Index. ...
     Iterating Over Dictionary In Alphabetical Order.

7)--How Do You Check The Presence Of A Key In A Dictionary?
ANS--using the Inbuilt method keys()

8)--Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?
ANS--The zip() function in Python is used to combine two or more iterable

     input iterable are paired together as tuples.
